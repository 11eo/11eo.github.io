Inspired by this TED talk @

It's true that climate change always seems distance, and people often discuss the topic using dry statistics that most people don't care or understand, or using scared-the-shit-out-of-everyone scenarios. Also, the 5 defenses that each person have regarding CC (climate change) are legit: distance, doom, dissonance, denial, identity.

Can climate change actions be fun? Let's try:

- Marching for the cause seems fun. Here's a database for upcoming marching //TODO

- Opting for a non-meat burger might be fun.

- Participating in energy-saving games with your friends/family can be fun: if you can catch a participant forgetting to turn off the light, or computer, or their car engine while not actively using it, that person has to pay you a small fee.

- How about growing a tree and make a sign with your loved one's name on it?

- How about growing veggies and going vegans to save money and the Earth?

- Making a mobile game in which players act as governments, and need to work together (including helping other nations, giving up some country-individual benefits, making new policies, encouraging Earth-friendly initiatives) in order to effectively fight CC, and teach Earth-saving practices, such as alternative energy, going vegans, biking instead of driving, electric vehicles instead of fueled ones, etc. at the same time?
